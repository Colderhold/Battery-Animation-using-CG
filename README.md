**Battery Animation using Computer Graphics**

**Description**

This project is an animation of a battery using computer graphics techniques. It demonstrates the visualization of a battery's charging and discharging process through a graphical representation. The animation provides a visual experience of the battery's energy level and can be used to enhance presentations or educational materials related to batteries.

**Features**

**Graphical Representation:**

The animation visually represents a battery using computer graphics.

It showcases the battery's shape, color, and energy level.

**Charging and Discharging Animation:**

The animation illustrates the charging process of the battery.

It depicts the gradual increase in the energy level with visual effects.

Similarly, it showcases the discharging process with a decrease in the energy level.

**Interactive Controls:**

The animation allows users to interact with the battery.

Users can simulate the charging and discharging process by controlling the energy level.

**Realistic Visual Effects:**

The animation utilizes computer graphics techniques to create realistic visual effects.

It may include shading, lighting, texture mapping, or other graphical enhancements.

**Technologies Used**

Computer Graphics: Various computer graphics techniques are used to create the battery animation.

Programming Language: The animation is developed using C++ programming language that supports computer graphics.

Graphics Libraries: Graphics libraries or frameworks may be utilized for rendering and displaying the animation, such as OpenGL, DirectX, or HTML5 Canvas.

**Usage**

Launch the battery animation program by running the compiled executable or script.

Interact with the battery animation using the provided controls or user interface.

Observe the graphical representation of the battery and its energy level changes during the charging and discharging process.
